Plan of Action: Phishing Attack Leading to Credential Compromise
I. Immediate Response (Detection & Containment)

Report & Isolate: User reports suspicious email/activity. The user should not click links or open attachments. IT/Security isolates the user's device from the network.

Verify Compromise:

Check for unusual login attempts, unauthorized access to accounts (email, cloud services, internal systems).

Review email logs for suspicious outbound emails.

Contain Affected Accounts:

Immediately reset passwords for the compromised user account and any associated accounts.

If MFA is not enabled, enable it immediately for the compromised account and promote it widely.

Review and revoke any suspicious API keys or OAuth tokens granted by the compromised account.

Block Malicious Indicators: Add sender email addresses, domains, and IP addresses from the phishing campaign to blocklists.

II. Investigation & Eradication

Forensic Scan: Perform a comprehensive scan of the user's device for malware or other malicious software.

Identify Data Exfiltration: Determine if any sensitive data was accessed or exfiltrated.

Communicate Internally: Alert all employees about the phishing campaign, providing examples of the malicious email and reminding them of reporting procedures.

Remove Malicious Content: Delete the phishing email from all user inboxes where it was received.

III. Recovery & Prevention

Restore Access: Once systems are clean and passwords reset, restore the user's access.

Reinforce Training:

Provide immediate, targeted security awareness training to the affected user.

Conduct organization-wide refresher training on phishing recognition and reporting.

Run simulated phishing campaigns regularly.

Enhance Email Security:

Review and strengthen email gateway rules and spam filters.

Implement DMARC, DKIM, and SPF to prevent email spoofing.

Review Access Controls: Regularly review user permissions and access levels to ensure least privilege.
