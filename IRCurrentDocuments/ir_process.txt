Incident Response Process (NIST Framework)

A. Preparation

Risk Assessment: Identify critical assets, potential threats, and vulnerabilities.

Security Controls: Implement preventative measures (MFA, firewalls, EDR, regular patching).

Backup Strategy: Implement and regularly test a robust backup and recovery plan (e.g., 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite/isolated).

Training & Awareness: Regular security training for all employees, incident response drills (tabletop exercises).

Tools & Resources:

Incident management platform/ticketing system.

Forensic tools.

Secure communication channels (out-of-band for compromised systems).

Contact lists for external experts (forensic investigators, legal, PR).

Documentation: Maintain up-to-date asset inventories, network diagrams, and emergency contacts.

B. Detection & Analysis

Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring (SIEM, IDS/IPS, endpoint monitoring) to detect anomalies.

Initial Triage:

Confirm the incident (is it a false positive?).

Gather initial information (what happened, when, where, who reported).

Determine severity and potential impact.

Activate the IRT based on severity.

Analysis:

Collect and analyze logs (system, network, application).

Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Determine the root cause, attack vector, and scope of the breach.

Preserve evidence for forensic analysis.

C. Containment

Short-Term Containment:

Isolate affected systems/networks (disconnect from network, disable compromised accounts).

Prevent further spread of the attack.

Implement temporary workarounds if necessary to maintain critical business functions.

Long-Term Containment:

Implement permanent solutions to prevent re-infection.

Patch vulnerabilities.

Enhance security controls.

D. Eradication & Recovery

Eradication:

Remove the root cause of the incident (e.g., malware, malicious scripts, backdoor access).

Clean infected systems.

Reset compromised credentials.

Recovery:

Restore systems and data from clean backups.

Verify system integrity and functionality.

Monitor closely for any signs of re-infection.

Gradually bring systems back online, prioritizing critical services.

E. Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)

Review & Analysis:

Conduct a post-mortem meeting with the IRT.

Analyze what went well, what could be improved.

Review the effectiveness of the response plan and implemented controls.

Document the incident thoroughly (timeline, actions taken, impact).

Actionable Improvements:

Update incident response plan, policies, and procedures.

Identify new security measures or training needs.

Share lessons learned with relevant teams.

IV. Communication Plan

Internal Communication:

Reporting procedures for employees to report suspicious activity.

Communication to internal stakeholders (leadership, employees).

External Communication:

Notification requirements (regulatory bodies, affected individuals, law enforcement).

Public statements (press releases, social media).

Coordination with legal and PR.
