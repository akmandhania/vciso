Plan of Action: Data Breach (General, Non-Ransomware)
I. Immediate Response (Detection & Containment)

Confirm Breach: Verify the legitimacy of the suspected data breach.

Scope Assessment: Determine the type of data compromised (e.g., PII, financial, intellectual property), the number of individuals affected, and the systems involved.

Containment: Isolate affected systems, revoke unauthorized access, and implement emergency patches to close the vulnerability exploited. Preserve logs and forensic evidence.

Activate IRT: Engage the full Incident Response Team, including legal counsel and public relations.

II. Investigation & Analysis

Forensic Investigation: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand how the breach occurred, the extent of data accessed/exfiltrated, and the attacker's methods.

Evidence Collection: Securely collect and preserve all relevant logs, system images, and other digital evidence.

Root Cause Analysis: Identify the specific vulnerability or human error that led to the breach.

III. Notification & Communication

Legal & Regulatory Assessment: Consult with legal counsel to understand breach notification obligations based on jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) and the type of data affected.

Notify Authorities: Inform relevant regulatory bodies and law enforcement as required by law.

Notify Affected Individuals: Prepare and issue breach notification letters/emails to affected individuals as per legal requirements, offering credit monitoring or other protective services if appropriate.

Public Relations: Develop a clear and transparent communication strategy for internal and external stakeholders, including media statements, FAQs, and dedicated support channels.

IV. Eradication & Recovery

Remediate Vulnerabilities: Fully eradicate the threat by patching the identified vulnerabilities, strengthening security configurations, and removing any backdoor access.

System Restoration: Restore affected systems from clean backups if necessary.

Enhanced Monitoring: Implement enhanced monitoring on affected systems and data to detect any further suspicious activity.

V. Post-Incident & Improvement

Post-Mortem Review: Conduct a detailed review of the incident to identify areas for improvement in security posture and incident response processes.

Security Enhancements: Implement long-term security enhancements, which may include:

Improved data encryption.

Stronger access controls and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.

Regular security audits and penetration testing.

Enhanced employee training on data handling and security best practices.

Update Plans: Revise the incident response plan and relevant security policies based on lessons learned.
