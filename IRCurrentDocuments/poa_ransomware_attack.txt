Plan of Action: Ransomware Attack
I. Immediate Response (Containment)

Isolate Infected Systems: Immediately disconnect affected systems from the network (unplug network cables, disable Wi-Fi). Do NOT shut down infected machines until forensic experts advise, as this can destroy volatile evidence.

Identify Scope: Determine which systems are infected, the strain of ransomware, and the initial point of compromise (if evident).

Activate IRT: Notify the Incident Response Team (IT, Security, Legal, Management).

Secure Backups: Ensure all valid, isolated backups are safe and inaccessible to the ransomware. Verify their integrity.

II. Investigation & Eradication

Forensic Analysis: Engage cybersecurity forensics experts to investigate the attack, identify the attack vector, and understand the full extent of the compromise.

Eradicate Ransomware:

Remove ransomware from all infected systems.

Patch all exploited vulnerabilities that allowed the ransomware to enter.

Reset all compromised user accounts and credentials.

Implement stronger access controls and MFA if not already in place.

No Ransom Payment (General Policy): Advise against paying the ransom as it does not guarantee data recovery and encourages future attacks. This should be a pre-determined policy.

III. Recovery

Prioritize Recovery: Identify mission-critical systems and data that need to be restored first based on business impact.

Restore from Backups:

Use verified clean backups to restore data and systems.

Restore in a segmented or clean environment first to ensure no re-infection.

Verify data integrity after restoration.

Rebuild Systems: For systems that cannot be safely restored, perform clean installations and reconfigure from scratch.

Monitor Post-Recovery: Continuously monitor all restored systems for any signs of lingering malicious activity.

IV. Post-Incident & Prevention

Lessons Learned: Conduct a thorough post-mortem to identify weaknesses and improve defenses.

Enhance Security:

Strengthen endpoint protection and network segmentation.

Implement robust email security filters.

Increase security awareness training focusing on phishing (a common ransomware vector).

Regularly review and update backup and recovery strategies.

Consider implementing an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.
