# VCISO Security IRP Assistant

**VCISO Security IRP Assistant** is an AI-powered tool designed to help organizations and individuals build, review, and test their security Incident Response Plans (IRP). Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Gradio web interface, it streamlines the process of managing and improving your security response posture.

**Main Features:**
- **IRP Builder:** Guided creation of an Incident Response Plan.
- **Policy Review & Compliance:** Automated review and compliance checking of your security policies.
- **Interactive Incident Response Guide (RAG-Only):** Step-by-step guidance through incident response procedures, team member assignments, and post-incident analysis—all powered by LLMs and RAG, with no direct file parsing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd viso
```

### 2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `viso/` directory with your OpenAI API key and any other required keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Or export it in your shell:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 5. Run the App

You can run any part of the Viso app using the `run.py` script:

```sh
python run.py --part part1  # For IRP builder
python run.py --part part2  # For policy review & compliance
python run.py --part part3  # For interactive incident response guide (RAG-only)
```

This will launch a Gradio web interface in your browser.

### 6. Usage
- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the assistant.
- Use commands like `overview`, `review`, `download`, and `progress` in the chat for additional features.
- For Part 3 (Incident Response Guide):
  - Type `start data_breach`, `start phishing`, or `start ransomware` to begin an incident simulation.
  - All incident response plans, team rosters, clarifications, summaries, and lessons learned are **synthesized by the LLM from relevant document chunks retrieved via RAG**. There is **no direct file parsing**—you can add, remove, or rename files in `IRCurrentDocuments` at any time.
  - The system will always use the latest content from your documents for every response.

## Architecture Notes (Part 3)
- **RAG-Only:** All content (plans, steps, team info, post-incident reviews, etc.) is generated by the LLM using only the chunks retrieved from your uploaded documents. There is no direct file reading or static parsing in the business logic.
- **Flexible Document Support:** Supports TXT, PDF, DOCX, and HTML files in the `IRCurrentDocuments` folder. You can organize your policy and plan documents however you like.
- **LLM-Powered Synthesis:** The LLM is prompted to generate step-by-step plans, team rosters, clarifications, and executive summaries based on the retrieved content, ensuring your guidance is always up-to-date with your latest documentation.

## Updating & Publishing
- Make sure to update this README if you add new features or dependencies.
- Ensure `plan_outline.txt` and other generated files are in `.gitignore`.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing API keys, check your `.env` file or environment variables.
- For dependency issues, try re-creating your virtual environment and reinstalling requirements.

## Sample Policy Documents

The `IRCurrentDocuments` directory contains sample policy documents (TXT, PDF, DOCX, HTML) for testing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. You can add, remove, or modify these files as needed for your own organization or experiments. The system will always use the latest content for all guidance and analysis.
